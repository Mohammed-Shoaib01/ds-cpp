## How to contribute to this repository?
- First things first, if you are looking for getting spammy PRs accepted, then this is not the place, sorry!
- Second, before starting to work on implementing a data structure to contribute here, please go through [this file](https://github.com/code-chaser/ds-cpp/blob/main/header/singlyLinkedList.hh); You are required to follow the conventions (formatting, nomenclature, etc) to get your PR accepted.
- Believe me, if you were actually going to make a meaningful contribution it won't take more than 5-10 extra minutes to code according to the conventions followed [here](https://github.com/code-chaser/ds-cpp/blob/main/header/singlyLinkedList.hh).
- NOTE: Before starting to work on making a contribution here, open an issue regarding that first, then start working if a maintainer assigns that issue to you.
- NOTE: **Please avoid spammy PRs**, thank you!
